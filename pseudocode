Computer needs to pick a random number (0-9) that remains hidden.

Human picks and keys number on keyboard.

If the number is the same number that the computer picked, a win is added to the win column, and everything is reset.

If the number is not the number that the computer picked, a guess is subtracted from "Guesses remaining" column; the incorrect number is added
and shown on the "Numbers chosen" row.

Once the "Guesses remaining" column is depleted, a loss is added to the "loss" column and everything is reset.
